# CarCam
Made with React Native, CarCam is a powerful dashcam app developed by Michael Yi and Jason Chen. Designed to promote safe driving while increasing accessility to dashcam-like software. Won third place out of 38 submissions in the Congressional App Challenge under Californiaâ€™s 45th Congressional District.

## Summary

As a student interested in computer science, Michael Yi was a great choice to work on this iOS application. Initially, we wanted to use Swift to create this application, however due to the limitations of Swift, we decided to use react-native.
